%I'm a Computer Scientist at the University of Southern California's 's
%Information Sciences Institute. 
My work focuses on improving performance of
scientific codes run on supercomputers with multi-core nodes, in
particular on developing strategies to efficiently schedule iterations of a 
computational loop of an application code on cores of a multi-core node, which was the focus of my PhD work. 

%During my PhD, my research focused on
%self-adaptive algorithmic strategies for use in High Performance
%Computing (HPC) codes,

Prior to my PhD work, I was
involved in the effort on Our Parallel Patterns developed by
University of California at Berkeley at University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, resulting in publications 13-14 and, later, 15-16. 
%TODO: connect the text below with other work. 
I also was involved in work on the MPI
shared memory extensions model for MPI-3, also known as the
MPI+MPI model, resulting in publication 11. Additionally, I worked on
performance optimizations 
a code involving a Lattice-Boltzmann computation that simulated blood flow of a human's
heart run on a cluster of multi-core nodes, resulting in publication 12. 
My dissertation work was studying and developing lightweight loop scheduling 
strategies to improve the scalability of bulk-synchronous MPI+OpenMP
application codes run on supercomputers with multi-core nodes. 
The work resulted in publications 1-10 and 16.
% A motivation for such self-adaptive
%algorithmic strategies is to optimize performance of such codes in the
%presence of the amplification problem, a problem projected to induce
%serious performance degradation when such codes are run on
%supercomputers on the order of 1,000,000 nodes. 
The scheduling strategies developed can be beneficial to mitigate the amplification
problem, a problem shown to cause serious performance bottlenecks for
bulk-synchronous and loosely synchronous MPI applications running on
next-generation supercomputers having on the order of 1,000,000 nodes,
as discussed in publications 7 and 10. The strategies have been applied to 
Communication-Avoiding dense matrix factorization codes, 
%specifically 
%Communication-avoiding LU and Communication-avoiding QR
studied in publications 5 and 8,
regular mesh computations, studied in publication 10, and n-body
simulations, studied in publications 4 and 6. 
%TODO: fix the below sentence to connect with above. 
Additionally, a general development methodology for the strategies was designed
for use in a variety of real-world numerical simulations. The effort to do so
was a study of composing different types of low-overhead
loop scheduling strategies to form new loop scheduling strategies and
resulted in publication 4. 


%I have worked on low-overhead dynamic scheduling strategies for
%performance tuning MPI+OpenMP codes on multi-core processors. 

My current work involves performance optimizations that include
techniques of auto-tuning and loop scheduling of ptychography solvers
intended to run on supercomputers having nodes with GPUs and/or MICs. 
I'm working towards a publication that describes performance
optimizations done to the application code.
I'm involved in the development of user-defined loop schedules
for OpenMP, resulting in publication 2. Additionally, I've done
research on a technique that combines OpenMP-style loop scheduling and
Charm++ load balancing, resulting in publication 1. 

%My PhD research was focused on self-adaptive algorithmic strategies
%for use in High Performance Computing (HPC) codes, specifically for
%BLAS operations (e.g., matrix-matrix multiplication), and dense matrix
%factorizations. A motivation for such self-adaptive algorithmic
%strategies is to optimize performance of such codes in the presence of
%the amplification problem, a problem projected to induce serious
%performance degradation when such codes
%are run on supercomputers on the order of 1,000,000 processors. A key
%focus was to provide the self-adaptive strategies as a software
%package to be used by real-world numerical simulations such as the
%simulation of blood flow in a human heart.
